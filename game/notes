player movement pseudocode

-decide on a speed (pixels per frame to move).

-a movement consists of moving in one of the eight possible directions, from the center
of one grid space to another. this takes several frames (10 for straight, 14 for diagonal?)

- we keep track of the movement by counting down the frames, and double check
  against the actual sprite position.

- when the movement is completed, if nothing has changed then another one shall commence
in the same direction. (recomputeTarget)

-a movement can be interrupted by a few things:
    - the grid forcibly stops us because we are running into something illegal.
        - On the next frame (before me move again), we should set the target as the closest exact grid position, and the frames
          based on how far away we are. This should work out evenly... if it doesn't then warp?
    - the player presses a new movement key.
        - we should change our movement direction intent, but wait until we finish the movement
          to actually start walking in a diff. direction.
    - the player releases a movement key.
       - if we still have some intent to move, then complete the ongoing movement
         and then move in the new direction next.
       - if we have no intent to move, do the same as when the grid stops us.
